And the man said to me, “Son of man, look with your eyes, and hear with your ears, and set your heart upon all that I shall show you, for you were brought here in order that I might show it to you. Declare all that you see to the house of Israel."
Ezekiel **40.4**



When I gave my heart to know wisdom and to see the preoccupation that is done on earth, because, indeed, by day and by night there is no seeing sleep with one’s eyes, then I saw all the works of God, that no one will be able to find out the work that is done under the sun; as much as one may toil to search out, he will not find; indeed, whatever the wise say they know, they will not be able to find it out.
Ecclesiastes 8.16-17 (NETS)
