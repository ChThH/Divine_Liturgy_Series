When I gave my heart to know wisdom and to see the preoccupation that is done on earth, because, indeed, by day and by night there is no seeing sleep with oneâ€™s eyes, then I saw all the works of God, that no one will be able to find out the work that is done under the sun; as much as one may toil to search out, he will not find; indeed, whatever the wise say they know, they will not be able to find it out.
Ecclesiastes 8.16-17 (NETS)
