## Old Testament
Some of you have probably wondered about the order of Biblical Books I have in my notes. Well, Most Bibles in English are arranged one way, but every version that's a translation of the Greek Old Testament seems to show a slightly different order. So I'm using the New English Tranlsation of the Septuagant (NETS), order as found on pages vii & viii. Mostly I'm using the traditional English names for the books (NETS uses Greek transliterations for many of them), but have notes alternates in the table.
