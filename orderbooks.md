## Old Testament
Versions of the Old Testament vary in the order of books, even among those translated from the Greek. (It appears the Greek Bibles themselves vary in thier order.) For the handouts, since they use the NETS translation as the primary translation for the Old Testament, that is the order chosen for the book list as well.
